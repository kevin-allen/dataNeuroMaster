    "3. Create a 1D spike count histogram containing the number of spikes as a function of head direction.\n",
    "4. Calculate the firing rate as a function of head direction.\n",
    "5. Try to apply smoothing to your firing rate histogram. You can use the function scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d(). Pay attention to the `mode` parameter of the gaussian_filter1d() function. What is the best `mode` given that you are using circular data (head-direction)?"
